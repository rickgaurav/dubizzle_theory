## Functionality to expose as API:

Dubizzle is a platform for people to buy and sell used things. Individuals can post the adds for things they want to sell.
At the same time there ae people who are in the business of selling and buying used stuff. For them, uploading and keeping a track of all the items will be quite a tedious task.

I would like to expose an API using which any number of items can be posted to website and at the same time some other supporting APIs can be written to make the posting, tracking etc easier for such people. 



Also by using the website, I can see there is a room for improvement in UI. Also there seems to be some bugs also For eg. I was not able to login using facebook and was also not able to register using my India phone number. I would like to work on such small things to make the experience smother for an end user so that user come back to site and not just leave frustrated.
